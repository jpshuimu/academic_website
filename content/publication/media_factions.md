abstract = "Can informal factions in competition under an authoritarian regime function as a power-sharing mechanism? In this paper, by analyzing the behavior of Chinese lower-level bureaucrats who are directly connected to top national leaders, we show that factions pursue power dominance through fewer factions rather than power-sharing among existing ruling groups. Using news reports in Chinese regional newspapers on corruption investigations from 2000 to 2014, our analyses find that political elites connected to powerful patrons are more likely to promote negative news about the members of other weaker factions and that these negative news reports by other provinces indeed harm the promotion prospect of reported province leaders. We also find that elite competition becomes less fierce when the distribution of political power is highly centralized or unclear, such as when top leaders exert excessive power or during the year of a National Party Congress. Our findings suggest that informal power competition does not act as an adequate substitute for institutional power-sharing mechanisms."
